# Changelog

All notable changes to StarUI will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- `star status` — color-coded component health table showing up-to-date, modified, update-available, and missing states via local checksum comparison against both manifest and remote registry; falls back gracefully when offline
- `star update` — smart component updater that compares remote checksums against local, skips already-current components, warns about locally modified files (skips by default), requires `--force` to overwrite modifications, and updates manifest after install
- `star diff <component>` — unified diff between local file and registry version for reviewing upstream changes before updating
- `star add` overwrite protection: detects conflicts, prompts with `confirm("Overwrite?", default=False)`, `--force` bypasses; existing dependencies are skipped automatically
- Registry manifest system (`.starui/manifest.json`) with SHA256 checksums, version tracking, and atomic writes

### Changed
- CLI config migrated from `starui.toml` to `[tool.starui]` in `pyproject.toml`, following Python ecosystem conventions
- All CLI commands now use unified config resolution: CLI flag > `pyproject.toml` > auto-detect
- `star init` accepts `--component-dir` flag and `--no-interaction` for CI usage
- `star build` and `star dev` now respect configured paths instead of hardcoding `static/css/`

### Fixed
- `star dev` hot-reload callback was always truthy even when disabled — now correctly `None` when `--no-hot-reload`
- `star build` result display treated `0` build time or `0` byte CSS as missing (truthiness vs `is not None`)
- `star build` swallowed deliberate `typer.Exit` in generic exception handler

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- `Menubar` component with hover-intent navigation, submenus, checkbox/radio items, and keyboard support
- `NavigationMenu` component with viewport popover, timer-based hover, and content panels
- `Pagination` component with sliding page window, jump-5 ellipsis, and reactive page state
- `SimplePagination` helper for common pagination patterns
- CLI `star status`, `star diff`, `star update` commands for component management
- Registry manifest system with checksum-based integrity verification

### Changed
- Registry restructured — components moved to `registry/components/`, metadata derived from source via AST
- Component conciseness audit across all 35+ components: consistent patterns, removed dead code, improved accessibility attributes

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- `Sheet` rewritten to use native HTML `<dialog>` with CSS transitions and backdrop animations
- `Dialog` and `AlertDialog` migrated to native `<dialog>` element
- `Tabs` variant system reworked — "plain" renamed to "line", new active indicator styling
- `Toast` ordering system with fixed-size slots and View Transition API animations
- `Calendar` added `caption_layout` parameter ("label" vs "dropdown"), shows outside dates
- `Command` added optional `shortcut` parameter for global keyboard triggers
- `Switch` added `size` parameter ("default", "sm")
- `DropdownMenu` smart scroll with `--popover-available-height` and overflow handling
- `CodeBlock` self-contained token colors, removed starlighter theme dependency
- `Alert` added `live` parameter for conditional `role="alert"`
- Component context passing simplified with new `inject_context()` utility
- Requires starhtml >=0.5.12

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- `Toast` / `Toaster` — Sonner-inspired notifications with success, error, warning, info, and destructive variants
